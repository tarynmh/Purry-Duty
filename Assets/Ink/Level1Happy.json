It was a very clear, sunny evening. Perfect fall weather for a stroll, if I must say.","\n","^Matches: My neighbors always leave treats out for me in the afternoon. They absolutely love me.","\n","^Matches: (But who doesn't?)","\n","^Matches: Well, meow, I was almost to the door when I heard something rustling in the bushes.","\n","^Matches: Before I even knew what hit me—or rather, what bit me—this cat flew out of the bushes and latched onto my EAR!","\n","^Matches: My precious ear! There's a notch in it now, how dreadful ...","\n","^Matches: Even though I was beside myself, I still managed to see who it was, clear as day. A tabby cat with amber eyes.","\n","^Matches: I'm not naming names, your Honor, BUUUUT ... there is conveniently someone in the neighborhood who matches that exact description, and they're standing in the courtroom right meow!","\n",{"#":"catChange judge"},"^Judge: Now, now, Matches, please hold your comments on the defendant.","\n","^Judge: Would you like to state your defense, Tiger?","\n",{"#":"catChange tiger"},"^Tiger: Yes, your Honor.

Do tell, meow.","\n",{"#":"catChange tiger"},"^Tiger: Matches says that she saw me, a tabby cat with orange eyes, at the scene. Yes, I live in the neighborhood, but she's missing something else.","\n","^Tiger: My owners have a camera right outside our door. I was able to obtain the footage from that day.","\n","^Tiger: And look here, that's me right outside my house! Basking in the sunlight as usual, your Honor. Not biting some sassy, stuck-up cat.","\n",{"#":"catChange none"},"^I see Matches shoot Tiger a menacing look, but she surprisingly stays silent.","\n","^And there I see it, up on the display screen.

How can you be two places at once?","\n","^From what I gathered about the case, Tiger's house is a ways away from Matches' house. It would surely have taken him at least 5 minutes to walk there, and that sure is a tight window for the crime to have taken place.","\n","^Not impossible, but ...","\n",{"#":"catChange judge"},"^Judge: And how do we know you haven't altered this footage in any way, Tiger?","\n",{"#":"catChange tiger"},"^Tiger: Your Honor, I'm a cat.","\n",{"#":"catChange judge"},"^Judge: Oh right. Continue, meow.","\n",{"#":"catChange tiger"},"^Tiger: I think this piece of evidence is irrefutable, your Honor. I'm sure the jury would agree. Not edited, in front of my house, and clearly me. I was no where NEAR the scene.","\n",{"#":"catChange judge"},"^Judge: Wait one second, meow. We received reports from the authorikitties that there is another cat in the neighborhood who is also a tabby cat with amber eyes.","\n","^Judge: They took him in for questioning, and the report shows that the cat claimed to have been sunbathing in the area around that time.","\n","^Judge: That cat could very well have been in front of your house, Tiger, and in this video footage.","\n",{"#":"catChange none"},"^The monitor switched to a photo of the cat next to a photo of Tiger. He really was a spitting image of the defendant. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought they were twins!","\n","^This definitely changed things, though. What if the other cat really was just outside Tiger's house? He could've seen it as a perfect set-up...","\n",{"#":"catChange matches"},"^Matches: Wait, your Honor! I have one more piece of evidence I've been saving, and this is something I simply cannot make up!","\n",{"#":"catChange judge"},"^Judge: Very well then, meow.

That could've been from any other time.","\n","^Tiger: And like I'd WANT to go over near that house anyway, where they feed and pamper you as if you're their own cat.","\n","^Tiger: It's not like I care about your picture-purrfect life where you get everything you want with a single meow!","\n","^Tiger: You always get what you want, Matches, and it's not fair!","\n",{"#":"catChange matches"},"^Matches: Why, I --","\n",{"#":"catChange judge"},"^Judge: Order!
